===

HMF (Hierarchical Memmap Format) is a Python package that provides user API similar to that of `PyTables <https://www.pytables.org/>`_ but uses `Numpy memmap <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.memmap.html>`_  for data storage. It also supports easy data sourcing from Pandas dataframe as well as parallel writing for speed.
